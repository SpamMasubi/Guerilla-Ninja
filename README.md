Plot: In 1974 during the Vietnam War, an ARVN Ranger and his platoon were on a recon mission. However, they were ambushed by enemy forces. With his team wiped out and being a sole survivor, the ARVN Ranger falls to his suppose death...at least to the enemy's knowledge. The Ranger was rescued by a mysterious man, who turns out to be a Japanese holdout since the Japanese occupation of French Indochina during World War II. The man is also the last of his ninja clan who nurtured him back to health, but also took him as an apprentice to teach him the art of Ninjutsu. When the ARVN Ranger returned from his last training, he returned to see the dojo burned down and his master killed. In a vengeful rage and anger, the Ranger vowed to avenge not only his master, but also his fallen soldiers of his platoon killed in the ambushed. Now, the Ranger takes the name of Guerilla Ninja and ventures deep into enemy territories of the jungle finding the enemy that killed his platoon and master.
